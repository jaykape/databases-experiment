# Database Experiment

This project is focused on exploring several database systems to understand their functionalities, interfaces, and integration with Python. 

## Objectives

For each database, the following aspects will be explored:

1. **Local Setup**

   * Spin up a Docker container version of the database.
   * Enable the databaseâ€™s web UI service (if available) for easier exploration.

2. **Exploration via Web UI**

   * Access the database through its web interface.
   * Explore schemas, tables, and data visually.

3. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**

   * Connect to the database using CLI.
   * Manage users and permissions.
   * Run basic database commands.

4. **Python Integration**

   * Connect to the database using Python libraries (e.g., `sqlalchemy`, `psycopg2`, `mysql-connector`, etc.).
   * Perform data operations:

     * Read and write data.
     * Create, modify, and drop databases/tables.
     * Execute queries programmatically.
